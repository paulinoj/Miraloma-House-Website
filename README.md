# Miraloma-House-Website

These are the files for the website I created for my Airbnb guests.
The website was created using Node.js, Express and Redis (for comments page).
The transportation page makes calls to the 511.org API to display real-time transit info.

The deployed website is located here:  https://miralomahouse.herokuapp.com
